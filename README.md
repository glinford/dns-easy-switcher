## Important Note

Due to macOS security requirements, administrator privileges are required each time you switch DNS settings. If you have a Touch ID-enabled Mac, you can now use Touch ID instead of password entry for authentication.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Administrator privileges (required for changing DNS settings)
- Touch ID compatible Mac (for Touch ID authentication feature)
